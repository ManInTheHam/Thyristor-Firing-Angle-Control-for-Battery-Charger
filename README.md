# Thyristor-Firing-Angle-Control-for-Battery-Charger


🔋 Thyristor Firing Angle Control for Battery Charger
This project implements a firing angle control system for a thyristor-based battery charger using phase angle control. By adjusting the firing angle of the thyristor, the voltage supplied to the battery can be precisely controlled, enabling safe and efficient charging. This method is particularly useful for lead-acid batteries where voltage regulation is critical to prevent overcharging.
